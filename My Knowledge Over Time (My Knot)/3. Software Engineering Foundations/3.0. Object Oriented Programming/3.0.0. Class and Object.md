# Class vs. Object

## 📌 The Concept
Think of a **Car Factory**:
1.  **Class (The Blueprint):** This is the paper design. It says "The car has 4 wheels, an engine, and a color." You cannot drive the paper design.
2.  **Object (The Car):** This is the actual car built from the blueprint. It takes up space in the garage. You can drive it.

## 💻 Code Comparison

### Python
```python
# The Blueprint (Class)
class Car:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color  # Property

    def drive(self):        # Method
        print(f"The {self.color} car is moving.")

# The Object (Instance)
my_car = Car("Red")
my_car.drive()
‍‍‍‍```

### TypeScript
```typescript
// The Blueprint (Class)
class Car {
    color: string; // Property

    constructor(color: string) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    drive(): void { // Method
        console.log(`The ${this.color} car is moving.`);
    }
}

// The Object (Instance)
const myCar = new Car("Red");
myCar.drive();
```
