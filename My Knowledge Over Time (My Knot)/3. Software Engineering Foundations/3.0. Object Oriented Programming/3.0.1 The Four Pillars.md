# The 4 Pillars of OOP

These are the rules to keep code clean and manageable.

## 1. Encapsulation (Protection)
**Concept:** Hiding sensitive data. You don't mess with the car's engine wires directly; you use the pedal.
*   **Python:** Uses `_` or `__` to indicate private variables (convention).
*   **TypeScript:** Uses `private` keyword (enforced by compiler).

## 2. Abstraction (Simplification)
**Concept:** Hiding complex logic. When you press "Brake", you don't need to know about hydraulics. You just want the car to stop.

## 3. Inheritance (Reusability)
**Concept:** Parents and Children. A "Truck" is a "Car" but with extra features. It inherits the wheels and engine logic from Car.

## 4. Polymorphism (Flexibility)
**Concept:** One interface, many forms.
*   The function `speak()` works for a Dog (barks) and a Cat (meows). The programmer calls `speak()`, the object decides what to do.
