# Interfaces & DTOs

## 1. DTO (Data Transfer Object)
**Concept:** A box used to carry data from one place to another. It has no logic, just data fields.
*   *Analogy:* A form you fill out at the bank. It ensures you provide a Name, ID, and Amount.

## 2. Interface (The Contract)
**Concept:** A rulebook. It defines *structure* but not *implementation*.
*   *Analogy:* A generic "USB Port". Any flash drive fits if it follows the USB "Interface" rules.

## 💻 Code Comparison

### Python (Using Pydantic/Dataclasses)
Python doesn't have native Interfaces like TS, but we use `dataclass` for DTOs.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# This is a DTO
@dataclass
class UserDTO:
    username: string
    email: string
```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript
// This is an Interface (The Contract)
interface MailService {
    send(email: string): void;
}

// This is a DTO (The Data Box)
class CreateUserDto {
    username: string;
    email: string;
}
```
