# Dependency Injection (DI)

## 📌 The Concept
**Don't build your tools inside; ask for them from the outside.**

*   **Bad Way (Hardcoded):** A flashlight with a battery soldered inside. If the battery dies, you throw away the flashlight.
*   **Good Way (DI):** A flashlight with a slot. You can "inject" any brand of battery (Sony, Duracell, or a Fake Testing Battery).

## 💻 Code Comparison

### Python (The Bad Way - Tight Coupling)
```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Vroom")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        # ❌ Bad: Car creates its own Engine.
        # We cannot change this engine easily.
        self.engine = Engine() 

    def drive(self):
        self.engine.start()
```

### TypeScript (The Good Way - Dependency Injection)

```TypeScript
interface Engine {
    start(): void;
}

class Car {
    private engine: Engine;

    // ✅ Good: We ASK for the engine.
    // We can pass a RealEngine or a FakeTestEngine here.
    constructor(engine: Engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    drive() {
        this.engine.start();
    }
}
```

## 💡 Why use DI?

1. **Testing:** You can swap a Real Database with a Fake Database for safe testing.
2. **Flexibility:** You can change parts of the system without rewriting the whole code.
