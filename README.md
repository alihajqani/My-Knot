# My Knot

After a long time, I thought I could gather the knowledge I already had, along with what I gain through daily programming tasks, into one concise place.  
I named this repository **My Knot**, which stands for ***My Kn*owledge *O*ver *T*ime**.

This repository will gradually be completed over time, so I can review it whenever I want,  and maybe it will be useful for someone else too.
